# Bright Motor Company ‚Äì Data Analysis

## üìä Overview

In this project, I analyzed the impact of rising CO‚ÇÇ concentrations on global temperature changes using historical data. It combines data preprocessing, visualization, statistical modeling, and performance evaluation to interpret climate trends and predict future behavior.

## üîç Key Insights
- The mean temperature change is around  **0.54¬∞C**, with a **median of 0.47¬∞C and variance of 0.43¬∞C**, indicating slight variability in temperature anomalies.
- For CO2 concentrations, the mean is **180.72ppm**, the median is **313.84** which is much higher than mean with the variance of **32,600**, which reflects substantial variability in CO2 level over the **1961 to 2022**. This shows the stronger fluctuation in CO2 data compared to temperature changes.
- A consistent increase in CO2 concentrations over the years, which can cause due the greenhouse gases. Simultaneously, there is a slight upward trend in global temperature change suggests that rising CO2 levels are associated with global warming.
- CO‚ÇÇ levels are rising rapidly, the temperature impact, though slower, is accumulating steadily and may have long-term consequences.
- The heatmap reveals a very strong positive correaltion (0.96) between Temperature Change and CO2 Concentrations.
- This graph highlights the seasonal changes in CO2 Concentration which peak during late spring and early summer (around May) and reach the lowest levels in fall (around September).
- Pearson Correalation (0.955) & Spearman Correlation (0.938) both indicates very string linear and monotonic relationship between CO2 Concentration and Temperature change.
- Granger Causality Test shows no proof for causality.
- 10% increase in CO2 results in a notable rise in temperature anomalies, which demonstrated the sentivity of global temperatures to CO2 levels. Conversely, a 10% - 20% reduction in CO2 could lead to significant cooling effects, which will potentially reverse some warming trends.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion
- There is **strong positive** correlation between rising **CO2 Concentration** and **Global temperature** Anomalies.
- CO2 levels are **increasing at a faster rate** than temperature changes.
- Time Series reveals a clear trends of **escalating emission driving temperature increases**, while seasonal variation suggest the moderate role of natural carbon sinks.
- Lagged effects suggest that **current CO2 levels have most significant impact on temperature changes**, with very small influence from the past emissions.
- Simulating "what-if" scenarios to demonstrate the sensitivity of Global temperature to CO2 levels, which shows that **even modest reduction in emissions could significantly ease global warming**.
